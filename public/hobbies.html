    Hello again! I have several hobbies that I'd like to do in my free time, scroll through them below:

    <ol>
        <li>
            Watching Youtube
            <br>
            Youtube is like my go-to time waster in life. But it's not all so bad, I actually learn a lot of things from Youtube. Many of my current hobbies were derived from Youtube (the skills!)
        </li>
        <li>
            Leathercrafting
            <br>
            Got hooked on this hobby of mine also from Youtube, got the skills also from Youtube. A very interesting and fun craft.
        </li>
        <li>
            Mechanical Tinkering
            <br>
            Now to the real time-waster. I like solving puzzles, this is no different. Why I say a real time-waster? Because I have no specialty or skills necessary to tinker anything mechanical, I just love taking stuffs apart and putting them back together, does it fix it? Nope!
        </li>
        <li>
            Drawing & Painting
            <br>
            Something I always love doing, ever since I was a little kid!
        </li>
        <li>
            Computer Games
            <br>
            No explanation needed, it's just so much fun!
        </li>
    </ol>
